SecretSanta.java was developed using JDK8 and Javax 1.6

JDK prior to 8 may also work, although it has yet to be tested.

For information about installing javax 1.6 please use their page here: https://javaee.github.io/javamail/docs/README.txt

javax's general information is available here: https://javaee.github.io/javamail/

Current Version: In order to use the Secret Santa program you must currently hard code the names and email of each person 
into the code. Future updates may include added functionality for being able to parse the information from a text file.
